        The natural gas markets are hanging around the 20 SMA at the moment on the four hour chart as we try to sort out where we are going next. It’s probably also worth noting that we are hanging around the $2.50 level, and this is an area that’s been very important. We have sold off quite drastically over the last couple of days, but we still aren’t making a fresh new low. I think at this point in time, it makes a lot of sense that we could see a certain amount of buying pressure underneath.

    <h4>Decleration</h4>
    <p>
        The MCX Natural Gas futures is down 6.5 per cent in March so far, and have declined over 51 per cent in the last five months, tracking the losses in its international counterpart. Natural Gas prices in the US have declined sharply owing to robust production and a seasonally warm winter, thus reducing demand for the energy-based commodity.
        As per reports, natural gas reserves stood well above its five-year seasonal average, owing to lower withdrawals from the inventories. In order to counter this, select natural-gas explorers have recently announced production cuts, and reduction in drilling activities.
