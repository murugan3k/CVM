<h3>COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS</h3>
<p>Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is used in traditional internal combustion engine automobiles that have been modified or invehicles which are manufactured for CNG use, either alone or in conjunction with another fuel such as Petrol (bi-fuel). CNG powered vehicles are considered to be highly economic and efficient compared to other fuel options. We, at Torrent Gas, are establishing CNG pumps across Pune District to make mobility highly economic.
